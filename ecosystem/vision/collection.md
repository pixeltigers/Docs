### Legendary Tigers

Yes! We have a total of **20** legendary Tigers. All our legendary Tigers are fully animated and stand out among the remainder of the collection.&#x20;

Legendary Tigers produce the most amount of $PIXELS per day. Only **10** legendary Tigers have been minted and the remainder will be available in the next phase of Tiger mint.

### Unique Tigers

You guessed it, uniques tigers are 1:1. There are **40** unique Tigers in total, some have been minted already and the remainder will be minted during the next phase.

### OG Tigers

Staying loyal to our early members, the first **1111** mints became OG Tigers which can be told apart using the gold border. The OG Tigers produce more $PIXELS than regular Tigers making them a valuable asset within our ecosystem.

### Non-OG Tigers

Content coming soon.&#x20;

## Cubs

Through the efforts of 2 different Tigers and 1000 $PIXELS, life can be given to a Cub.&#x20;

All Cubs born through $PIXELS will have their own unique traits, with a maximum of **8888** Cubs to be bred. Cubs are crucial to our ecosystem. These little cuties will have their own utility within The Jungle.&#x20;

Create a pack and you'll be ready for anything to come.

### Unique Cubs

Out of the 8888 Cubs, there will be an unknown amount of Cubs that will have a unique feature meaning they are 1:1.&#x20;

Unique Cubs are scattered around the collection so everybody has a chance of breeding a unique Cub.

## Mutated / Evolved Tigers

Sometime in the future within the Jungle tigers may get affected by deadly creatures, some may survive, but the remainder will be infected!
