No more grinding for Whitelists spots! PixelTigers Jungle Shop is a marketplace where you can use $PIXEL generated by your Tigers to purchase WL spots for upcoming NFT projects via Metamask.&#x20;

Shop items are also available for non-Tiger owners however there is a slight price increase for each item! Plus you have to get your hands on some $PIXEL first ðŸ¤­

### Can I request a WL for the shop?

Yes, you can do this via our Discord, there is a shop suggestion channel intended to be used for this purpose.&#x20;
