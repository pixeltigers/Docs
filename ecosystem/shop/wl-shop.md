PixelTigers Whitelist (WL) shop consists of minting pass for projects NFT projects. The native form of payment in the shop is $PIXEL. Using the $PIXEL generated by your Tigers you can purchase an item via MetaMask.

Shop items are also available for non-Tiger owners however there is a price increase for each item! plus you have to get your hands on some $PIXEL first ðŸ¤­
