# Breeding & Evolution

As you journey further into The Jungle you will be able to evolve/mutate your Tigers under extreme circumstances.&#x20;

## Breeding

Breeding is a process of using 2 Tigers (Genesis) and 1000 $PIXEL to breed a Cub!

## Evolution / Mutation

In the near future, serums will be purchasable in exchange for $PIXEL. This serum will allow Tigers to evolve further in the Metaverse.&#x20;

More details will be revealed as Tigers explore beyond The Jungle.
