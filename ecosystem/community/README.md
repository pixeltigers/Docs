# Community

Community is everything. We are a community-run project. We believe in organic community growth. No invite contests. No grinding for levels. No painful hours in the discord. We only have room for those who want to interact with our amazing community.

All decisions are made by the community via the council. Every major decision is voted on by the holders, we value every member!
