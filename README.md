# Welcome to The Jungle

![](.gitbook/assets/Pixeltigers\_logo\_lg.webp)

The Jungle is a place with a single rule: survival of the fittest.&#x20;

PixelTigers have long existed in this special realm, ever since the world dived into the blockchain and never looked back. Here, they discovered that living things have no need for air, food, or water to survive, but only one resource, pixels. \
\
Brimming with energy, they were the only source of survival. PixelTigers soon realised they further needed $PIXEL to breed and expand. Come and collect pixels with us in The Jungle - and as for what choices you make, it's up to you.
